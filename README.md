This is an ASP.NET MVC project using an Okta custom authentication server (https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/customize-authz-server/overview/) configured for a web application and using OpenId Connect/OAuth 2.0 for authentication/authorization.

A helpful walthrough guide for the implementation can be found at: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/aspnetcore3/configure-packages/.
